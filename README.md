# jmod_throwables
A repository for the upcoming Garry's Mod addon and JMod addition, JMod Throwables. (Name is subject to change)

### Currently addition plans are:
- Howitzer, a powerful cannon capable of launching all small EZ bombs and lots of custom cannon shot. [ Almost done ]
- Small cannon, capable of launching grenades, some custom shot and EZ rockets. [ Waiting for first cannon finalization ]
- Huge bombard, capable of launching massive munitions and knocking down your opponent's fortress. [ Still in idea stage ]
- Trashcan cannon, can launch most things the howtizer can, but not very far. Consider use as a mortar or trap. [ Still in idea stage ]
- Ship's gun, like the small cannon but comes pre-attached to a ship's cannon carriage for easy setup on board yer favorite saling vessel, yar. [ Stil in idea stage ]
- Overwatch Canister Launcher, A large stationary machine and cannon combination that launches headcrab canisters with custom payloads. [ Stretch goal ]

### There are also plans to add custom shot for nearly every JMod EZ resource.
- Steel, Standard shot, somewhat explosive.
- Ceramic, hard knocker, fragments on impact.
- Copper, a super capacitor round with a chain lightning impact.
- Lead, grapeshot, turn your cannon into a shotgun.
- Titianium, bar shot for dismantling your enemy's contraptions.
- Tungsten, armor peircing dart, no explosion.
- Uranium, armor pericing, but with fallout.
- Aluminum, Silver, Gold, and Platinum are in consideration for capability.
- Other EZ resources may or may not get a type of shot.

### Other things I might potentially do depending on time and support:
- Custom models for some of the guns.
- Better sounds.
- Accept suggestions.

### Some other features include: 
- Adjustable propellant usage for EZ range modification
- A system to help physical projectiles get around server velocity limits.
- A dynamic EZ grenade and EZ SLAM pickup system that 'SWEPifies' EZ grenades to make them more useable. [ May move this into base JMod ]
